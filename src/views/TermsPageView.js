We use the following types of Cookies:</p><ul role="list"><li>Essential Cookies. Essential Cookies are required for providing you with features or services that you have requested.

Most browsers have an option for turning off the Cookie feature, which will prevent your browser from accepting new Cookies, as well as (depending on the sophistication of your browser software) allow you to decide on acceptance of each new Cookie in a variety of ways. You can also delete all Cookies that are already on your computer. If you do this, however, you may have to manually adjust some preferences every time you visit a site and some of the Services and functionalities may not work.</p><p>To explore what Cookie settings are available to you, look in the “preferences” or “options” section of your browser’s menu.

Personal identifiers.</li><li>B. Customer records identified by state law.</li><li>C. Music listening history through third-party providers.</li></ul><p><em>Sales of Personal Data</em></p><p>We will not sell your Personal Data, and have not done so over the last 12 months.</p><h3><strong>Data Security and Retention</strong></h3><p>We seek to protect your Personal Data from unauthorized access, use and disclosure using appropriate physical, technical, organizational and administrative security measures based on the type of Personal Data and how we are processing that data. For example, the Services use industry standard Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology to allow for the encryption of Personal Data you provide to us. Although we work to protect the security of your account and other data that we hold in our records, please be aware that no method of transmitting data over the Internet or storing data is completely secure. We cannot guarantee the complete security of any data you share with us, and except as expressly required by law, we are not responsible for the theft, destruction, loss or inadvertent disclosure of your information or content.</p><p>We retain Personal Data about you for as long as you have an open account with us or as otherwise necessary to provide you with our Services. In some cases we retain Personal Data for longer, if doing so is necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes or collect fees owed, or is otherwise permitted or required by applicable law, rule or regulation. We may further retain information in an anonymous or aggregated form where that information would not identify you personally.</p><h3><strong>Personal Data of Children</strong></h3><p>As noted in the Terms of Use, we do not knowingly collect or solicit Personal Data from children under 13; if you are a child under 13, please do not attempt to register for or otherwise use the Services or send us any Personal Data. If we learn we have collected Personal Data from a child under 13, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that a child under 16 may have provided us Personal Data, please contact me at <a href="mailto:sam@roughdraft.ai">sam@roughdraft.ai</a></p><h3><strong>California Resident Rights</strong></h3><p>If you are a California resident, you have the rights outlined in this section. Please see the “Exercising Your Rights” section below for instructions regarding how to exercise these rights. If there are any conflicts between this section and any other provision of this Privacy Policy and you are a California resident, the portion that is more protective of Personal Data shall control to the extent of such conflict. If you have any questions about this section or whether any of the following applies to you, please contact me at <a href="mailto:sam@roughdraft.ai">sam@roughdraft.ai</a></p><p><em>Access</em></p><p>You have the right to request certain information about our collection and use of your Personal Data over the past 12 months. We will provide you with the following information:</p><ul role="list"><li>The categories of Personal Data that we have collected about you.</li><li>The categories of sources from which that Personal Data was collected.</li><li>The business or commercial purpose for collecting or selling your Personal Data.</li><li>The categories of third parties with whom we have shared your Personal Data.</li><li>The specific pieces of Personal Data that we have collected about you.</li></ul><p>If we have disclosed your Personal Data for a business purpose over the past 12 months, we will identify the categories of Personal Data shared with each category of third party recipient.</p><p><em>Deletion</em></p><p>You have the right to request that we delete the Personal Data that we have collected from you. Under the CCPA, this right is subject to certain exceptions: for example, we may need to retain your Personal Data to provide you with the Services or complete a transaction or other action you have requested.

We will only use Personal Data provided in a Valid Request to verify you and complete your request. You do not need an account to submit a Valid Request.</p><p>We will work to respond to your Valid Request within 45 days of receipt. We will not charge you a fee for making a Valid Request unless your Valid Request(s) is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded. If we determine that your Valid Request warrants a fee, we will notify you of the fee and explain that decision before completing your request.</p><p>You may submit a Valid Request using the following methods:</p><ul role="list"><li>Emailing me at: <a href="mailto:sam@roughdraft.ai">sam@roughdraft.ai</a></li></ul><p>You may also authorize an agent (an “Authorized Agent”) to exercise your rights on your behalf. To do this, you must provide your Authorized Agent with written permission to do, and we may request a copy of this written permission from your Authorized Agent when they make a request to exercise your rights on your behalf.</p><p><em>We Will Not Discriminate Against You for Exercising Your Rights Under the CCPA</em></p><p>We will not discriminate against you for exercising your rights under the CCPA. We will not deny you our goods or services, charge you different prices or rates, or provide you a lower quality of goods and services if you exercise your rights under the CCPA. However, we may offer different tiers of our Services as allowed by applicable data privacy laws (including the CCPA) with varying prices, rates, or levels of quality of the goods or services you receive related to the value of Personal Data that we receive from you. ****</p><h3><strong>Other State Law Privacy Rights</strong></h3><p><em>California Resident Rights</em></p><p>Under California Civil Code Sections 1798.83-1798.84, California residents are entitled to contact us to prevent disclosure of Personal Data to third parties for such third parties’ direct marketing purposes; in order to submit such a request, please contact me at <a href="mailto:sam@roughdraft.ai">sam@roughdraft.ai</a></p><p>Your browser may offer you a “Do Not Track” option, which allows you to signal to operators of websites and web applications and services that you do not wish such operators to track certain of your online activities over time and across different websites.

Samuel Winslow will be the controller of your Personal Data processed in connection with the Services.</p><p>If there are any conflicts between this this section and any other provision of this Privacy Policy, the policy or portion that is more protective of Personal Data shall control to the extent of such conflict.
